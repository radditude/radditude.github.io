  <h2>get in touch</h2>

  <p>I'm always happy to chat, especially with folks who are new to the tech industry and/or took an unconventional path to get there.</p>

  <p>The best way to reach me is by email at <a id="email-clipper">{{ site.author.display_email }}</a>. <span id="clipper-confirm">Copied to your clipboard!</span></p>

  {% assign github = site.author.social | where:"title","github" %}
  {% assign bluesky = site.author.social | where:"title","bluesky" %}
  {% assign linkedin = site.author.social | where:"title","linkedin" %}

  <p>I don't really do much social media-ing these days, but you can find me as @radditude in various places around the web: <a href="{{ github.first.url }}">GitHub</a>, <a href="{{ bluesky.first.url }}">BlueSky</a>, and <a href="{{ linkedin.first.url }}">Linked</a>.</p>
