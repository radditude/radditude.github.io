  <h2>whoami</h2>

  <p>I'm a senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">HashiCorp</a>, working on <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> and <a href="https://www.terraform.io/cloud">Terraform Cloud</a>. Previously, I was a software engineer at <a href="https://revelry.co/">Revelry</a>. I use <a href="http://pronoun.is/they/">they/them</a> pronouns. </p>

  <p>I tried my hand at a few other things before I found my way to programming: I have a music degree, spent a while doing freelance production work for the publishing industry, and at one point narrowly escaped becoming a public librarian.</p>

  <p>My work has allowed me to explore many layers of the stack as well as the spectrum from product engineer to infrastructure engineer. I've architected holistic product features, worked on interactive UIs, led complex backend rearchitectures, and debugged obscure data consistency issues between production services.</p>

  <p>I value that broad experience because it means I'm always expanding my mental model of the system and how changes to one part affect the whole.</p>

  <p>When not at my laptop, I'm usually walking in the woods, reading scifi (the campier the better), or submitting to the whims of my local feline overlord.</p>
