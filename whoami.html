  <h2>whoami</h2>

  <p>I'm a senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">HashiCorp</a>, working on <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> and <a href="https://www.terraform.io/cloud">Terraform Cloud</a>. Previously, I was a software engineer at <a href="https://revelry.co/">Revelry</a>. I live in Portland, OR, grew up in the South, and use <a href="https://pronoun.is/they/">they/them</a> or <a href="https://pronoun.is/he/">he/him</a> pronouns. </p>

  <p>I tried my hand at a few other things before I found my way to programming: I have a music degree, worked as a dog handler, spent a while doing freelance production work for the publishing industry, and at one point narrowly escaped becoming a public librarian.</p>

  <p>My career so far has allowed me to explore many layers of the stack as well as the spectrum from product engineer to SRE. I've architected holistic product features, led complex backend rearchitectures, commanded incidents, and tracked down scaling bottlenecks in distributed systems at scale. I enjoy expanding my mental model of a system and how changes to one part affect the whole.</p>

  <p>I'm deeply fascinated by the socio parts of sociotechnical systems: understanding how people use the software I write, reducing toil and human error during development and release, and enjoying the alchemy of a team that is greater than the sum of its parts. </p>
  
  <p>When not at my laptop, I'm usually lifting something heavy, exploring the beautiful Pacific Northwest, reading scifi (the campier the better), or submitting to the whims of my local feline overlord.</p>
