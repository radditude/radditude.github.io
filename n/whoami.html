  <h2>whoami</h2>

  <p>I have an unusual background for a developer. Or really for anyone. Some fun facts about me:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I've read Dante's <em>Inferno</em> in the original 14th century Italian</li>
    <li>I once worked the night shift at a doggy daycare</li>
    <li>I've performed with a professional symphony orchestra</li>
    <li>I used to teach basic computer and web literacy at a public library</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a programmer, I've worked all across the stack, from fixing IE10 bugs in a React component library to tracking down race conditions in a Redis email queue to diagnosing problems with a git-based deploy tool for Kubernetes. I've also worked in a decent variety of languages and frameworks, but Ruby, Go, and Elixir will always have my heart.</p>

  <p>I like making stuff and solving problems for the people around me. I care a lot about how my work fits into the bigger picture: is it reliable? is it secure? will it make users' and/or coworkers' lives a little better?</p>

  <p>When not at my laptop, I'm usually walking in the woods, reading scifi, or submitting to the whims of my local feline overlord.</p>
