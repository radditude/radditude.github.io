  <h2>whoami</h2>

  <p>I'm a senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">HashiCorp</a>, working on <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> and <a href="https://www.terraform.io/cloud">Terraform Cloud</a>. Previously, I was a software engineer at <a href="https://revelry.co/">Revelry</a>. I use <a href="http://pronoun.is/they/">they/them</a> pronouns. </p>

  <p>I tried my hand at a few other things before I found my way to programming: I have a music degree, spent a while doing freelance production work for the publishing industry, and at one point narrowly escaped becoming a public librarian.</p>

  <p>I've worked all across the stack, from building complex interactive UIs to tracking down obscure data consistency issues between backend services to orchestrating the gradual rollout of a major framework upgrade. I value that broad experience because it means that I'm always improving my mental model of the system and how changes to one part might affect the whole.</p>

  <p>When not at my laptop, I'm usually walking in the woods, reading scifi (the campier the better), or submitting to the whims of my local feline overlord.</p>
