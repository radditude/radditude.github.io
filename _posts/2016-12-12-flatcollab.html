<h4> (Ruby | Rails | Devise | Postgres | Semantic UI) </h4>

<p>
    FlatCollab is a stylish, lightweight collaboration app I made for my fellow students at the Flatiron School. It's built with Ruby on Rails and uses Devise and Omniauth for authentication. Postgres (via ActiveRecord) adds database support. The frontend is a single-page app built in jQuery (hey, it was an experiment!). The styling is based on Semantic UI.
