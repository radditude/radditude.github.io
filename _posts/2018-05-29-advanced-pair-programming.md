title: 'Advanced Pair Programming'

The research is in – pair programming is awesome. At the cost of about a 15%
increase in development time, pairing produces code with fewer errors, and even
makes us happier at work. I’m here to help you take your pair programming skills
to the next level.

Seriously, though: those claims are supported by actual research. Download the
respective PDFs here:

But if you take a cross-section of developers, you’ll find some very mixed
opinions about pairing. Some devs hate it. Some devs write blog posts about how
great it is.

Developing pair programming skills means handling the learning curve Why the
divide? It’s easy to hand-wave away by muttering something something soft skills
and leave it at that – which is exactly why I dislike the term “soft skills.”
It’s too often used in a nebulous way to indicate something that’s the opposite
of hard, aka technical, skills.

In reality, the two are highly complementary skill sets. It’s hard to
collaborate with someone without learning from them, which is a really effective
way to ramp up your technical skills. Done right, it becomes a positive feedback
loop where the development of soft skills reinforces the development of
technical skills and vice versa.

But it’s true that there’s a learning curve to pairing. Think of picking up an
unfamiliar musical instrument for the first time: at first it’s not much fun, as
you fumble over fingerings and pick your way through unfamiliar notation, but it
rapidly becomes more rewarding as you get comfortable with the basics.

So with that in mind, think of these tips & techniques as ways to help get over
the discomfort of that initial curve and into a place where you can enjoy the
benefits of pairing.
