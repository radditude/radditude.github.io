title: 'Asking Bad Questions'

Like many people, I have a certain fear of being That Person – you know, the one
asking a ton of annoying or obvious “bad questions”. Julia Evans’

on asking good questions is one I return to over and over.

At the same time, though, there’s a lot of value to asking some not-so-great
questions when building software. Open-ended questions and questions that seem
to be confirming the obvious can help interrogate assumptions and make sure we
build the right thing, as well as building the thing right.

So today, I want to talk about a few different types of “bad” questions, and
make the case for just asking the question regardless of its objective goodness.
