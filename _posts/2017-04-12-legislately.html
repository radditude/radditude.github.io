<h4> (Angular | Javascript | Ruby | Rails | Devise | Postgres | Bootstrap) </h4>

<p>
    LegisLately is a fun little app that was definitely not inspired by current events. Users can search for their elected representatives and follow them to get a newsfeed of recent votes and activity.
</p>

<p>
    The meat of this app is in the front end, an SPA built in AngularJS 1.5 and styled with Bootstrap and Sass. The back end is an API-only Rails application that mostly exists to handle data from two external APIs - the ProPublica Congress API and the Google Civic Information API. The PostgreSQL database's job is simply to hang on to users' credentials and information on who they follow.
