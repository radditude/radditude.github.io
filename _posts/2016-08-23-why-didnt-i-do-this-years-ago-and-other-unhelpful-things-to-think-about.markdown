> Why did you decide to learn software development?

It's a question I'm not sure how to answer. I'd dabbled for years, dipping into HTML & CSS tutorials, doing the odd Javascript demo here and there, nothing too serious. Then, one day in January, I woke up thinking *I want to learn how to code. For real.*

Since then, I've found that programming and making stuff gives me back the sense of purpose I've been missing ever since I decided that a life spent shaking and throwing up before performances as a professional clarinetist was not what I wanted from my short time on this Earth. I discovered that I love getting lost in a problem, patiently trying out solutions until finally the pieces click together and my program lurches to life.

But that doesn't really answer the question.

Maybe it's better to come at it from a different angle. Why did I decide to learn software development *now*? Why am I just now, at age 28, discovering that coding is not just something I can do, but something I have a real aptitude for?

Why didn't I do this years ago?

Put that way, the question is easier to answer. Part of the answer is that I'm female, and thus the patterns of my life conspired to convince me that while I might enjoy math and technical subjects well enough, it was dangerous to compete with the boys. I was a boy-crazy high schooler, and I learned that the quickest way to make a man lose interest was to beat him at something. Easier to stick to English - girls are supposed to be good at English.

Another part is that my dad works in IT, so for a long time I associated "coding" with "things that Dad does," with all the accompanying uuugggghhhs that you can expect from a teenage girl. I wanted to strike out and blaze my own trail. Software development was Dad's thing. I wanted my own.

After high school, I plunged into music school and a terrible, destructive relationship, and I didn't have time to think about anything else for several years. Then came a few years surviving on poorly paid jobs, occupied with keeping my head above water.

I still can't tell you why I woke up that day and decided to seriously apply myself to learning this complex, massive thing. But I think that maybe, for the first time in my life, I didn't have a reason not to.
