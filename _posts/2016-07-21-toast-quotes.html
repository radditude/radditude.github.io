<h4> (Javascript | Bootstrap) </h4>

<p>
    My first interactive web project, this page displays random quotes from <a href="http://the-toast.net/" target="_blank">the-toast.net</a>, an internet favorite of mine that closed its figurative doors in July 2016. The responsive layout is built with Bootstrap and Javascript.
