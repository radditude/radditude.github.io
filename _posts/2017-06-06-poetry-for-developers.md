## Because I could not stop for Tests

Because I could not stop for Tests –<br />They kindly stopped for me –<br />The
Console held but just “Build failed” –<br />And failure Messages three.

I fixed the first – a Feature, broken<br />By a clever turn of Code –<br />I
fixed the second, a Syntax error,<br />I fixed the third – oh no –

Since then – ’tis Centuries –<br />and yet One stubborn Test I see<br />I must
surmise this Testing suite<br />Tests but my urgency

## The Merge Conflict Not Taken

Two files diverged in a Git repo,<br />And sorry I could not include
both<br />And have one project, long I stood<br />And thought through one as far
I could,<br />To where it fell victim to JS growth;<br />Then picked the other,
just as fair,<br />And having perhaps the better claim,<br />Since it used ES6
syntax, writ with care.<br />Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />Yet
knowing how change leads on to change,<br />I doubted if I should return to this
git stash.<br />I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />In some blog post ages
hence:<br />Two files diverged in a repo, and I–<br />I took the one more
modernized,<br />And that has made all the difference.

## The Slackbot

_or_

##### Accidentally Setting a Slack Reminder for Midnight Instead of Noon

Once upon a midnight dreary,<br />While I pondered, weak and weary,<br />Over
many a quaint and curious<br />File of outdated code,<br />While I nodded,
nearly napping, <br />Suddenly there came a tapping,<br />As of a Slack
notification happening,<br />Happening on my laptop screen,<br />“’Tis some
@here ,” I muttered,<br />“Happening on my laptop screen –<br />Only this and
nothing more.”

Back into the code returning,<br />Blinking dry eyes to stop the
burning,<br />Soon again I heard a tapping<br />Just the same as came
before.<br />“Surely,” said I, “surely<br />That’s a general
notification;<br />Let me see, then, what it is,<br />And this mystery explore
–<br />Let my heart be still a moment<br />And this mystery explore; –<br />’Tis
a general notification, and nothing more!”

Open then! I pulled up Slack,<br />And then, with much alas, alack,<br />I saw a
new DM awaiting -<br />“It’s midnight, for God’s sake!”, I swore.<br />A server
failure? A botnet attack?<br />I closed my eyes and clicked it fast,<br />I read
the message, blinked, and laughed;<br />And felt relief set in at last,<br />For
on the screen was naught but<br />A reminder that I’d set that morn:<br />Quoth
the Slackbot, “Nevermore.”
